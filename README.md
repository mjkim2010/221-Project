Classify.py: main source of code used to read test.csv, train.csv, and implement our Multinomial and Binomial Naive Bayes algorithms

diseases.txt: shows relationship between disease and symptoms; easy readability

test.csv, test2.csv: 2 examples of how we tested our data; collection of diverse symptoms

train.csv: dataset of ~N = 50; relates each disease to a vector of symptoms
